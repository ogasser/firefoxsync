# Heartbleed Monitor Privacy Notice

April 17, 2014

Mozilla cares about your privacy. When Heartbleed Monitor sends information to us, our [Mozilla Privacy Policy](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/) describes how we handle that information.

## Things you should know
After installation, Heartbleed Monitor checks the vulnerability of https supported websites to the Heartbleed Bug.  You can check a website's status by clicking the heartbleed icon on Firefox. It will display as either "Vulnerable" or "Not Vulnerable".

* **What information do you receive?**: Each time you visit a new https supported website we receive the hostname (not the full URL) of the website to run a vulnerability check. Firefox caches the status locally and re-checks it at regular intervals to notify you of updates.  We don't keep logs of IP addresses and cannot identify you or your browsing history.  

* **What else can I do?**: Clicking on the icon gives you an option to clear cookies.  If you select this option, Firefox will automatically clear cookies from each site you visit as an additional protection against the Heartbleed Bug.
